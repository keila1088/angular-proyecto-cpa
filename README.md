# Ng Users Practice / Docs


## Stage 1

Create a repository called "ng-users-practice" using the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli). Confirm that you want to add routing to the project, and select Sass as the css compiler. 

In `src/app`, create a new module called "core". Inside "core" module, create directories for components and services.

Your `src/app` directory structure should look like this:

```bash
.
├── app-routing.module.ts
├── app.component.html
├── app.component.scss
├── app.component.spec.ts
├── app.component.ts
├── app.module.ts
└── core
    ├── components
    ├── core.module.ts
    └── services
```

*You could add a `.gitkeep` file in components and services directory*.

Add the paths to the `src/app` and `src/app/core` directory in your `tsconfig.json` file.

Import "core" module into "app" module.

*Optionally, add some logic to allow the "core" module to be loaded once.*

## Stage 2

In "core" module, create 3 components:
* a component for the home page, called "home"
* a component for missed urls, called "page-not-found"
* a component for the main navigation, called "topnav"

*You could remove the `.gitkeep` file from components directory*.

In the app routing module `app-routing.module.ts`, import the "home" and "page-not-found" components. Create an empty path for the "home" component, and a wildcard path for the "page-not-found" component.

In the "topnav" component, add a navigation with a link to the "home" component.

In the "app" template, remove all html generated by Angular CLI and add the "topnav" component and the `<router-outlet>`.
